knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

####Data Source 

```{r}
#data source :[Kaggle Competitions]-Titanic Dataset 

#https://www.kaggle.com/hesh97/titanicdataset-traincsv

```

####Importing data in R

```{r}
mydata <- read.csv("titanic.csv")
```

####Descriptive Statistics of variables 

```{r}
library(psych)
psych::describe(mydata)
#Important Note****:
#1. Output displays descriptive statistics of all the 12 variables of the dataset which includes categorical variables. Reason being function's default is to recode categories as numbers.
#2.When the function recodes a categorical variable into a numeric variable, it denotes this by adding an * at the end of the variable name.
```

####Categorical Variables

```{r}
#Pclass and Survived both are categorical variable but are been read as integer variable in R and hence the descriptive statistics for both the categoricals are outputed differently.

sapply(mydata,class)

 
summary(mydata$Pclass)
summary(mydata$Sex)
summary(mydata$Survived)
```

####Variable Transformation

```{r}
#We are transforming Pclass and Survived to factor variables [reason being both the categorical variables have been read as numeric in R]

names<- c('Pclass' , 'Survived')
mydata[,names] <- lapply(mydata[,names], factor)
summary(mydata$Pclass)
summary(mydata$Survived)
```

####Plotting Scatterplot

```{r}
age   = mydata$Age
fare  = mydata$Fare
class = mydata$Pclass
gender= mydata$Sex

#Both variables are numeric
plot(fare, age, main = "Numeric Variables",
     xlab="Fare", ylab = "Age", pch=19)
abline(lm(age ~fare), col="blue")
lines(lowess(fare, age),col="red")

#Numeric + Categorical variable
plot(class, age, 
     main="Numeric + Categorical Variables",
     xlab="Class", ylab= "Age", pch=19)


```
